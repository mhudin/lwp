Welcome to the Lightweight Preprocessing (LWP) repository.

The associated code is in the project folder:

LWP.py – This file contains all 5 steps of LWP

CNNs.py – This file contains the code for the ResNet50 and ResNet152V2 networks. Path strings will likely require changes.

extractor.py – This file contains the code used to extract the image data from the DICOM. Unfortunately, we were not able to provide the DICOMs or other data due to IRB restrictions, but it should work on similarly-constructed DICOMs

The code here is publicly available. I only ask that you reference where you got the code from if you intend to use it in some way for a publication.
